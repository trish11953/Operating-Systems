# Operating-Systems

Welcome to my Operating Systems Repository! This repository is a collection of various projects and experiments I have worked on in the domain of operating systems during my academic and professional journey. These projects showcase my understanding of various operating system concepts, such as process management, memory management, file systems, and inter-process communication.

## Introduction
Operating systems are a crucial component of computer systems, responsible for managing hardware resources and providing an interface for users and applications. This repository contains projects that demonstrate my skills in various operating system concepts, such as process scheduling, memory allocation, file system implementation, and more.

## Projects
Here's a list of some topics covered in this repository:

Process Scheduling Simulator: Implementing a process scheduling simulator that supports various scheduling algorithms, such as FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin.

Page Table and TLB Implementation: Implementing a simulation of a three-level page table and a translation lookaside buffer (TLB) to handle virtual-to-physical address translation and demonstrate the benefits of hierarchical paging and TLB caching.

Simple Map-Reduce WordCount Application: Creating a simple map-reduce application that processes a large text dataset and counts the occurrences of each word, demonstrating the use of parallel processing and inter-process communication for efficient data analysis.

Dynamic Storage Allocator: Designing and implementing a dynamic storage allocator that supports memory allocation and deallocation requests. Writing functions like malloc, free, realloc, heapchecker, etc from scratch.

## Dependencies
The projects in this repository mainly rely on the following programming languages and libraries:
C
POSIX Threads Library (pthreads)
Standard Template Library (STL)
