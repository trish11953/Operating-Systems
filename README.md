# Operating-Systems

Welcome to my Operating Systems Repository! This repository is a collection of various projects and experiments I have worked on in the domain of operating systems during my academic and professional journey. These projects showcase my understanding of various operating system concepts, such as process management, memory management, file systems, and inter-process communication.

## Introduction
Operating systems are a crucial component of computer systems, responsible for managing hardware resources and providing an interface for users and applications. This repository contains projects that demonstrate my skills in various operating system concepts, such as process scheduling, memory allocation, file system implementation, and more.

## Projects
Here's a list of some of the projects included in this repository:

Process Scheduling Simulator: Implementing a process scheduling simulator that supports various scheduling algorithms, such as FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin.
Memory Allocation Simulator: Creating a memory allocation simulator that demonstrates different memory allocation techniques, such as First-fit, Best-fit, and Worst-fit.
Simple File System: Designing and implementing a simple file system with support for basic file and directory operations.
Producer-Consumer Problem: Implementing a solution for the classic producer-consumer problem using semaphores for synchronization and inter-process communication.
Each project directory contains a detailed README file that explains the project's objective, concepts involved, and instructions for execution.

## Dependencies
The projects in this repository mainly rely on the following programming languages and libraries:
C
POSIX Threads Library (pthreads)
Standard Template Library (STL)
